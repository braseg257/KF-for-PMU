This is the repository of the codes used to apply Kalman Filter to retrieve the position angle of the BBM PMU rotor using encoder data from the second 2023 cryogenic run.

Use KF_demo.ipynb to directly apply Kalman Filter to a tdms file.

KF-for-PMU.pdf is a quick hands on guide to apply the KF without knowing all of the technical details of the algorithm.

The complete report is avaiable at Goracci_CMB_Inflate_Report.pdf
